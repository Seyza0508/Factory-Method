# Factory-Method
This Java application implements a pizza ordering system with a graphical user interface (GUI), showcasing object-oriented programming concepts. The core of the system is the abstract Pizza class, which defines common attributes like toppings, cheese, and sauce and abstract methods for getting the description and price of a pizza. Subclasses like PepperoniPizza, VeggiePizza, MargheritaPizza, and CustomPizza extend Pizza, providing specific implementations of these methods. The CustomPizza class is unique as it calculates the price based on the number of toppings.

The application employs the Factory Design Pattern with the PizzaFactory interface and its concrete implementations for each pizza type, encapsulating the pizza creation process. The PizzaOrderingSystemGUI2 class, extending JFrame, builds the GUI. It includes interactive elements like combo boxes for pizza selection, checkboxes for toppings, and buttons to place or clear orders. The GUI responds to user actions, dynamically updating pizza details and the total price. A Queue<Pizza> manages the pizza orders, demonstrating the use of Java collections. This program is an exemplary blend of GUI development and object-oriented design, ideal for educational purposes or as a foundation for more complex applications.
